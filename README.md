# Deep-Learning

Today, I am going to start my grand tour in deep learning. Review what I have learnt and try new things.

## Datasets: 
1. Image: coco, flower, bird
2. NLP: 

## Model:
* CNN 
* RNN (LSTM),attention
* GAN: DCGAN, AttnGan, CycleGAN
* Deep RL: value based, policy gradient, actor critic, ...

## Read papers:

## Do my own research:
* Optimization methods
* How each layer works
