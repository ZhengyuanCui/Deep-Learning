# Deep-Learning

Today, I am going to start my grand tour in deep learning. Review what I have learnt and try new things.

## Datasets: 
1. Image: coco, flower, bird
2. NLP: 

## Model:
1. CNN 
   - VGG16
   - PixelCNN
   - Yolo
2. RNN (LSTM),attention
3. GAN: 
   - DCGAN
   - AttnGan
   - CycleGAN
4. Deep RL: value based, policy gradient, actor critic, ...

## Read papers:

## Do my own research:
   - Optimization methods
   - How each layer works
