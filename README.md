# Deep-Learning

Today, I am going to start my grand tour in deep learning. Review what I have learnt and try new things.

## Datasets: 
### Image: 
1. coco
2. flower
3. bird
4. CIFAR-10 and 100
### NLP: 

## Model:
### CNN 
1. VGG
2. PixelCNN
3. Yolo
### RNN (LSTM),attention
### GAN: 
1. DCGAN
2. AttnGan
3. CycleGAN
### Transformers:
1. Implement from scratch [Done]
### Deep RL: value based, policy gradient, actor critic, ...

## Read papers:

## Research directions:
### visual and language intergration (express them in numbers with same sequence of number expressing same meaning)
### Device a common network to process those information (self decide how many parameter to include in the model)
### Small points 
1. Optimization methods
2. Stableize methods
